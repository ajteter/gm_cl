# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing Next.js-based HTML5 games portal from Cloudflare Workers (using OpenNext) to a purely static solution that can be deployed on Cloudflare Pages. The goal is to eliminate all server-side rendering and dynamic functions to take advantage of Cloudflare Pages' unlimited free requests for static content.

The current project is a games portal that displays HTML5 games from GameMonetize, with features including game listings, random game selection, and embedded game playing. It currently uses Next.js with some client-side components but still relies on server-side rendering for some pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a site visitor, I want to browse and play games on a completely static website, so that the site loads faster and has better reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page THEN the system SHALL serve only static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
2. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL NOT make any server-side function calls
3. WHEN a user loads the game list THEN the system SHALL fetch game data from a static JSON file
4. WHEN a user accesses the random game page THEN the system SHALL select games using client-side logic only

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate all Next.js server-side rendering dependencies, so that the project can be deployed as a purely static site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN the system SHALL generate only static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL NOT require any server-side runtime
3. WHEN the project is deployed THEN the system SHALL NOT use any Cloudflare Workers or Pages Functions
4. WHEN examining the build output THEN the system SHALL contain no server-side components or API routes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want to maintain all existing functionality while using only static files, so that users experience no degradation in features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the home page THEN the system SHALL display the game list with pagination
2. WHEN a user visits the random game page THEN the system SHALL show a daily selected game
3. WHEN a user plays a game THEN the system SHALL properly handle URL parameters for ad attribution
4. WHEN a user navigates the site THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing SEO metadata and structure
5. WHEN ads are displayed THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing ad placements and functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace Next.js with a static site generator, so that the build process produces only static files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN choosing a replacement framework THEN the system SHALL use a static site generator that supports React components
2. WHEN the new framework is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing component structure where possible
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL generate static HTML files for all routes
4. WHEN the project is configured THEN the system SHALL support the existing CSS modules and styling approach

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a site visitor, I want the site to work correctly when deployed to Cloudflare Pages, so that I can access all features without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site is deployed to Cloudflare Pages THEN the system SHALL serve all content as static files
2. WHEN a user accesses any URL THEN the system SHALL return the appropriate static content
3. WHEN the site is accessed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper routing for single-page application behavior
4. WHEN examining Cloudflare analytics THEN the system SHALL show zero function invocations
5. WHEN the site loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the same performance characteristics as the current implementation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve the existing project structure and data flow, so that maintenance remains straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing component file structure
2. WHEN handling game data THEN the system SHALL continue using the existing games.json file
3. WHEN implementing routing THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing URL patterns
4. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing CSS modules approach
5. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL produce a similar directory structure for easy deployment
