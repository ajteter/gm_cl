# Feature Specification: Project Summarization

**Feature Branch**: `001-`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ËØªÂèñÈ°πÁõÆ‰∏≠ÁöÑÊâÄÊúâÊñá‰ª∂ÔºåÊÄªÁªìËøô‰∏™È°πÁõÆÁöÑÊñπÊñπÈù¢Èù¢"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer new to a project, I want to quickly get a high-level overview of the codebase, so that I can understand its structure, technologies, and key components without reading every file.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a project repository, **When** I run the summarization tool, **Then** I receive a Markdown document summarizing the project.
2. **Given** the tool is run, **When** the summary is generated, **Then** it should include sections for tech stack, project structure, and key dependencies.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the tool is run in an empty directory?
- How does the system handle very large files or binary files?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST scan all files and directories in the project.
- **FR-002**: System MUST respect `.gitignore` and other common ignore files to exclude irrelevant content.
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify the primary programming languages and frameworks used.
- **FR-004**: System MUST list key dependencies from package management files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`).
- **FR-005**: System MUST outline the overall directory structure.
- **FR-006**: System MUST identify potential build, test, and deployment scripts.
- **FR-007**: The output summary MUST be in a structured Markdown format.
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle errors gracefully (e.g., unreadable files).
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a way to specify the root directory to scan. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this be a command-line argument? Or does it always use the current working directory?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle different text encodings. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What encodings should be supported? Default to UTF-8?]
